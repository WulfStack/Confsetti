## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Confsetti, please send an email to the maintainers of the project. You can find contact information in the AUTHORS file in the root of the repository.

Please do **NOT** create GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account when acknowledging your contributions.

## Disclosure Policy

When a security issue is reported, we will take the following actions:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.

These fixes will be released as fast as possible, and you will be publicly acknowledged for your efforts (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
