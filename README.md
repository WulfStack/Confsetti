# üéâ Confsetti

Confsetti is a powerful configuration library for Node.js and Browsers. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use API to manage your application's configuration data.

## Introducing the WulfStack

Confsetti is part of the WulfStack, a collection of purpose-built libraries designed to do one thing, and do it well. The philosophy behind the WulfStack is simplicity and efficiency - each library is designed with minimal dependencies, no bloat, and no nonsense. We believe in keeping things simple, with additional features available as separate packages to keep the core libraries lean and efficient. You can explore the other packages that are designed to work seamlessly with Confsetti on the [WulfStack website](https://wulfstack.stormwulf.com).

## What is Confsetti?

Confsetti is a configuration library inspired by [convict](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict) and [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig), designed to be extremely lightweight for use with TypeScript, NodeJS and JavaScript in the browser. It supports schemas in either JSONSchema format or a simplified, opinionated schema format. Written in TypeScript from scratch, Confsetti has built-in, extendable type validation, ensuring your configuration is not only flexible but also robust and reliable.
